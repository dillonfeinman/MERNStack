//1. what is react and its role for single page application

React is a  javascript library  that allows you to build single page applications by dynamically updates the states of the content
to render the changes without rerendering the whole page.

//2. how react is faster compared to other javascript frameworks

React is  faster because it does not have to render the whole page on a small change. It uses Virutal DOM to compare the previous states 
and updates only the items that were changed

//3. what is virtual dom

The virtual dom is a representation of a DOM object and is used to only update what has changed in the DOM.

//4. how react renders dom in conservative manner

React renders dom conservatively by comparing the Virtual DOM (current) to the real DOM(previous) and only updates what is necesary
to set the real DOM to what the VDOM is
